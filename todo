the class should be changed to only deal with state of the database connection/database,
not handle sending things to discord channels
	for example, the "post_random_link()" method should be something more like:
	"random_link()" and have it return a random link instead of just sending it
the command handler should use the new command group structure.
	this should allow much easier managing of commands


await ctx.message.add_reaction('\U0001F44D')

done* add images to anonymous album
done* keep imgur link (or ID) and delete hash
done* rehost image with command ".w rehost 33" to rehost existing database link to imgur

send error messages to discord, so people know what is going on

add fmk map in sqlite.  many to many relationship, so it can track who fmked which images.
	this would involve making a table of discord user ids
		and a table mapping many users to many images
